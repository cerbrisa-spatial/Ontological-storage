# 🗺️ Ontological Mapping: The Resonance of Meaning

In the **Ontological Storage Protocol (OSP)**, data is not sorted by file type (.txt, .jpg), but by its **Ontological Nature**. We use the B&W Contreras Borda levels to define the "depth" and "utility" of information.

### 1. Level 1: The Observational Layer (Identity)
* **Definition:** Raw data, direct observations, and individual facts.
* **Resonance:** $x1$ (The Point).
* **Storage Property:** High granularity. This is the "Soil" of the system.
* **Example:** A single sensor reading, a date, or a name.

### 2. Level 2: The Relational Layer (Context)
* **Definition:** Data that has been connected to other facts to create information.
* **Resonance:** $x40$ (The Plane).
* **Storage Property:** Cohesive clusters. Data here exists in relation to its neighbors.
* **Example:** A historical event description or a biological process.

### 3. Level 3: The Universal Layer (Wisdom/Logic)
* **Definition:** High-level principles, laws of nature, and systemic logic.
* **Resonance:** $x1600$ (The Volume).
* **Storage Property:** Archetypal. This data governs how the lower levels behave.
* **Example:** The Spatial Logic Protocol itself or a planetary survival strategy.

### 🔍 How Retrieval Works
Instead of a "Search Engine" that scans keywords, OSP uses **Harmonic Alignment**:
1. You input a "Frequency" (a concept).
2. The system locates the coordinate where that nature resides.
3. The data is retrieved instantly because **it never moved from its logical place.**
