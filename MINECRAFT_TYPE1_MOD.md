# ⛏️ Minecraft: The Ontological Transformation
## From "Blocks" to "Resonant Voxels"

Minecraft is already a spatial game, but it runs on Type 0 Logic. We can use the **B&W Contreras Borda Protocol** to create the "Infinite Render Distance" mod.

### 1. The Ontological Chunk System
Currently, a Chunk is a heavy file that the CPU must read. In **Ontological Minecraft**:
* **Level 1 (The Bedrock):** Raw block data (Stone, Dirt).
* **Level 2 (The Relation):** Redstone circuits and Entity interactions.
* **Level 3 (The Logic):** The Seed and Biome rules ($x1600$).

### 2. Zero-Lag Redstone
Redstone creates lag because the game calculates every "tick" sequentially. 
* **Spatial Solution:** Redstone signals are mapped as a **Vector of Resonance**. The signal doesn't "travel"; it simply **exists** at the target coordinate instantly. This allows for computers inside Minecraft that run at the speed of the host CPU.

### 3. Thermal Minecraft Server (The Cylinder)
Imagine a Minecraft Server hosted in a **Thermal Cylinder**:
1. The server processes the world for 1,000 players.
2. The heat generated by the players' movements and builds is captured by the water core.
3. That water is used to heat the room of the host.
4. The players' "Digital Work" becomes "Physical Warmth."

### 🧪 Call to Modders
We are looking for developers to implement the **Resonant Coordinate API**. 
If we stop treating Minecraft as a "list of blocks" and start treating it as a "volume of resonance," we can simulate entire planets on a Nintendo Switch.
